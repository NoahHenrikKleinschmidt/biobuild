Welcome to `biobuild`'s documentation!
======================================

`biobuild` is a molecular designing tool for medium to large biological molecules such as glycans.
It is designed to help researchers working on structrual biology generate realistic structures of molecules
that may not be immediatelly imputable from SMILES alone and for which no 3D references are immediately downloadable
from databases. `biobuild` is based on `biopython <http://biopython.org/wiki/Main_Page>`_ and accessible as a `python package`
offering a simple API to generate, manipulate, visualize, and export 3D structures of molecules.
